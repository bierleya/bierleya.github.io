            <hr>

            <h4>Brief Introduction</h4>
            <p>I was born in San Jose, California, on September 10th, 1999. I lived in the quaint English village of Whissendine 
                for three years from the age of 2 to 4, but have lived in busy Silicon Valley ever since. While my love for the 
                Bay will never diminish, I am always seeking new experiences and challenges, and my college search led me to 
                temporarily reside in rural Minnesota. I graduated with a computer science degree in 2021 from Carleton College, 
                which is located roughly 45 minutes south of the Twin Cities. After graduation, I relocated to Madison, Wisconsin
                to work as a software developer at Epic, a healthcare company.</p>

            <h4>Why I chose computer science</h4>
            <img src="cs.jpg" class="cs">
            
            <p>I find computational systems fascinating, and software opens up limitless possibilities for everyone. 
                I chose computer science because I believe I can contribute to the betterment of society through software 
                development (and it's lots of fun!). I am interested in both back and front end development and am eager to 
                continue expanding my skillset as a software engineer.</p>
            <p>I am particularly interested in learning about the ways that technology positively impacts sports, education, 
                and environmental sustainability. I have also developed an appreciation for machine learning, and I think 
                entering the field of computer vision could be fascinating.</p>
            <p>I enjoy working with different APIs, any sort of graphics, and artificial intelligence. 
                Some of my favorite projects that I've done include building an AI for Settlers of Catan, 
                setting up a generative adversarial network to convert landscape photographs to Van Gogh style paintings, and 
                developing an AI model to detect instances of illegal dumping and presence of hazardous materials given drone 
                or satellite footage.</p>

            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
            <p>Soccer has been an influential part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started playing when I was four, and played 
                for four years in the United States Soccer Development Academy — the highest level league in the country — and represented 
                the San Jose Earthquakes during my sophomore year in high school. I played collegiate soccer for Carleton College, 
                and semi-professionally for Breakers FC in the USL League 2. I'm a huge Aston Villa fan, and support 
                both the United States and English national soccer teams.</p>

            <p>Aside from soccer, I enjoy playing tennis and basketball recreationally. Working out is a huge part of who I am, and I also 
                spend a lot of time in the gym. In my free time, I prefer to be outdoors, going on hikes, going camping, or going to the 
                beach. When I'm not outdoors, playing chess or cards are some of my favorite things to do.</p>
